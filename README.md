# Walmart_Sales_Prediction
Machine Leanring mini project 

Walmart sales prediction is performed by taking walmart.csv as input file. Various Machine Learning algorithms are applied to the dataset such as Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest and Support Vector. R-square (R2) score and Mean Squared Error (MSE) are used as evaluation metrics. Performance analysis of the above algorithms on the given dataset is done. At last prediction of a new data point is performed.
